# Stress Testing

Nimbus includes a built-in stress testing system that simulates player load across your backend servers without requiring real Minecraft clients. This lets you validate scaling rules, find performance bottlenecks, and determine optimal `players_per_instance` values before going live.

## How it works

The stress test manager simulates player load on backend servers. Simulated players:

- Count toward each service's player total (triggering the scaling engine naturally)
- Are reflected in proxy player counts and MOTD
- Respect each service's `max_players` cap

::: info
Only **backend groups** receive simulated players. Proxy groups are excluded from stress tests.
:::

## Console commands

### Start a test

```bash
# Simulate 100 players across all backend groups
nimbus> stress start 100

# Target a specific group
nimbus> stress start 200 BedWars

# Ramp up gradually over 60 seconds
nimbus> stress start 500 --ramp 60
```

### Check status

```bash
nimbus> stress status
```

Shows active test details: total simulated players, capacity, and per-service breakdown.

### Adjust mid-test

```bash
# Ramp to a new target without stopping
nimbus> stress ramp 300

# Ramp over 30 seconds
nimbus> stress ramp 300 --duration 30
```

### Stop

```bash
nimbus> stress stop
```

All simulated players are removed and services return to normal.

## In-game commands

The bridge plugin exposes stress testing via `/cloud stress`:

```
/cloud stress start 100 Lobby 30
/cloud stress stop
/cloud stress ramp 200 60
/cloud stress status
```

Requires the `nimbus.cloud.stress` permission.

::: tip
The in-game commands follow the format `/cloud stress start <players> [group] [rampSeconds]` and `/cloud stress ramp <players> [durationSeconds]`.

## REST API

All endpoints require bearer token authentication.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/stress` | Current status (active, players, capacity, per-service) |
| `POST` | `/api/stress/start` | Start a stress test |
| `POST` | `/api/stress/stop` | Stop the active test |
| `POST` | `/api/stress/ramp` | Adjust target mid-test |

### Start via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/stress/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"players": 100, "group": "Lobby", "rampSeconds": 30}'
```

### Check status via API

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/stress \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "totalPlayers": 100,
  "targetPlayers": 100,
  "capacity": 400,
  "services": {
    "Lobby-1": 40,
    "Lobby-2": 40,
    "Lobby-3": 20
  }
}
```

### Ramp via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/stress/ramp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"players": 200, "durationSeconds": 60}'
```

## Scaling interaction

The stress test is designed to exercise your scaling rules naturally:

1. Simulated players fill backend services up to `max_players`
2. The scaling engine detects rising fill rates and starts new instances (up to `max_instances`)
3. When you stop the test or ramp down, empty instances are stopped after `idle_timeout`

This means you can validate your entire scaling pipeline -- from scale-up thresholds to idle timeouts -- without coordinating real players.

## Best practices

### Finding the right players_per_instance

Run progressively larger tests and watch server performance:

```bash
nimbus> stress start 50 BedWars --ramp 30
# Monitor TPS via screen command
nimbus> screen BedWars-1
# Check if TPS stays above 19.5

nimbus> stress ramp 100 --duration 30
# If TPS drops, your players_per_instance is too high
```

### Testing scale-up and scale-down

```bash
# 1. Start with your normal config and ramp to trigger scaling
nimbus> stress start 200 Lobby --ramp 60

# 2. Watch new instances start
nimbus> status

# 3. Ramp down and verify cleanup
nimbus> stress ramp 10 --duration 30

# 4. Wait for idle_timeout, then check instances stopped
nimbus> status
```

### Monitoring during tests

Use `screen` to attach to a service console and watch TPS, memory, and tick times:

```bash
nimbus> screen Lobby-1
# Press Ctrl+C to detach
```

The `status` command shows per-instance player counts during the test. The REST API at `/api/metrics` provides historical data for post-test analysis.

::: warning
Stress tests simulate player counts without spawning actual entities on servers. This is a lightweight way to test your auto-scaling configuration.
:::

## Limitations

- **Proxy groups are excluded** -- only backend groups receive simulated players
- **max_players is respected** -- each service is capped at its configured `max_players`
- **max_instances is respected** -- the scaling engine will not exceed the group's `max_instances`
- **Console spam suppressed** -- `StressBot-*` events are filtered from the console output
- **No real gameplay** -- simulated players do not move, interact, or generate chunk load. CPU load is lower than real players.

::: tip
Because simulated players do not generate chunk load or entity interactions, real-world performance may differ. Use stress tests for scaling validation and baseline benchmarks, then fine-tune with real players during a beta phase.
