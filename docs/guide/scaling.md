# Auto-Scaling Guide

Nimbus includes an auto-scaling engine that dynamically adjusts the number of running instances per group based on player demand. This ensures you always have enough server capacity without wasting resources on idle instances.

## How scaling works

The scaling engine runs a continuous loop:

1. Every **heartbeat interval** (default: 5 seconds), ping all `READY` services via [Server List Ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping) to update player counts
2. For each **dynamic** group, count players on **routable** services (those with no custom state)
3. Apply the scale-up and scale-down rules

Static groups are never auto-scaled.

## Scale-up

The engine scales up when the **fill rate** exceeds the **scale threshold**:

```
fill_rate = total_players / (routable_count * players_per_instance)

if fill_rate > scale_threshold
   AND routable_count < max_instances
→ start one new instance
```

**Example:** A BedWars group with `players_per_instance = 16` and `scale_threshold = 0.8`:

| Routable servers | Players | Fill rate | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 20 | 62.5% | No action |
| 2 | 27 | 84.4% | Scale up (> 80%) |
| 3 | 27 | 56.3% | No action |
| 3 | 40 | 83.3% | Scale up (> 80%) |

::: info
Only one instance is started per evaluation cycle. This prevents over-provisioning during sudden spikes. If demand continues, another instance will start on the next cycle (5 seconds later).
:::

## Scale-down

The engine scales down when a service has been **empty for longer than the idle timeout**:

```
if service.playerCount == 0
   AND service has been empty for > idle_timeout seconds
   AND routable_count > min_instances
→ stop that service
```

The idle timer starts when a service's player count drops to zero and resets if any player joins.

::: warning
If `idle_timeout` is set to `0`, scale-down is **disabled** -- empty instances will never be stopped automatically. This is the default, and appropriate for lobbies that should always be running.
:::

## Custom states and routing

Services can have a **custom state** set by game plugins via the SDK (e.g., `"WAITING"`, `"INGAME"`, `"ENDING"`). Services with a custom state are treated specially:

- **Excluded from routable count** -- they don't count toward capacity calculations
- **Never scaled down** -- even if empty, a service mid-game won't be stopped
- **Not chosen for routing** -- the proxy won't send new players to them

This is critical for game servers. Without custom states, a BedWars server mid-game would count toward capacity, and the scaling engine might not start new instances even though no server is actually accepting players.

```java
// In your game plugin:
Nimbus.setState("INGAME");    // Server is no longer routable
// ... game plays out ...
Nimbus.clearState();          // Server is routable again
```

### How custom states affect scaling

Consider a BedWars group with 4 instances:

| Service | Players | Custom State | Routable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| BedWars-1 | 16 | `INGAME` | No |
| BedWars-2 | 14 | `INGAME` | No |
| BedWars-3 | 8 | `null` | Yes |
| BedWars-4 | 0 | `null` | Yes |

The scaling engine sees: **2 routable** servers, **8 total routable players**. Fill rate = 8 / (2 * 16) = 25%. No scale-up needed.

If BedWars-4 fills up:

| Service | Players | Custom State | Routable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| BedWars-3 | 14 | `null` | Yes |
| BedWars-4 | 14 | `null` | Yes |

Fill rate = 28 / (2 * 16) = 87.5% > 80% threshold. A new instance (BedWars-5) starts.

## Configuration

Scaling is configured per group in the `[group.scaling]` section:

```toml
[group.scaling]
min_instances = 1          # Minimum instances (always running)
max_instances = 10         # Maximum instances (hard cap)
players_per_instance = 16  # Expected players per server
scale_threshold = 0.8      # Scale up at this fill rate (0.0 - 1.0)
idle_timeout = 300         # Seconds before stopping an empty server
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `min_instances` | `1` | Floor -- instances are started on boot to meet this |
| `max_instances` | `4` | Ceiling -- scaling will never exceed this |
| `players_per_instance` | `40` | Used to calculate fill rate |
| `scale_threshold` | `0.8` | Fill rate that triggers scale-up (80%) |
| `idle_timeout` | `0` | Seconds empty before scale-down (0 = disabled) |

## Practical examples

### Lobby servers

Always-on, spread players evenly. Never scale down below 1.

```toml
[group]
name = "Lobby"
type = "STATIC"

[group.scaling]
min_instances = 1
max_instances = 4
players_per_instance = 100
scale_threshold = 0.8
idle_timeout = 0             # Never stop lobbies
```

### BedWars (minigame)

Ephemeral servers that scale with demand. Stop empty servers after 5 minutes.

```toml
[group]
name = "BedWars"
type = "DYNAMIC"

[group.scaling]
min_instances = 1
max_instances = 10
players_per_instance = 16
scale_threshold = 0.8
idle_timeout = 300

[group.lifecycle]
stop_on_empty = false        # Let idle_timeout handle it
restart_on_crash = true
max_restarts = 3
```

### Survival server

Single persistent instance, no scaling needed.

```toml
[group]
name = "Survival"
type = "STATIC"

[group.scaling]
min_instances = 1
max_instances = 1
```

### Event mode

Expecting a traffic spike? Temporarily increase capacity:

```toml
[group.scaling]
min_instances = 5
max_instances = 20
players_per_instance = 50
scale_threshold = 0.7        # Scale earlier for headroom
idle_timeout = 600
```

Or edit the group config file and reload:

```bash
nimbus> reload
```

## Manual scaling

### Console commands

```bash
# Manually start an instance
nimbus> start BedWars

# Manually stop an instance
nimbus> stop BedWars-3

# View current scaling state
nimbus> status
```

### REST API

```bash
# Start a new instance
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/services/BedWars/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Stop a specific instance
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/services/BedWars-3/stop \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Monitoring

The `status` command shows current scaling state for all groups:

```
nimbus> status
```

This displays:
- Active instances per group
- Player counts per instance
- Custom states
- Scaling bounds (min/max)

## Tuning tips

### Threshold selection

| Threshold | Behavior | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `0.6` | Scale early, lots of headroom | Competitive games where lag = lost players |
| `0.8` | Balanced (default) | Most use cases |
| `0.95` | Pack tightly, minimal waste | Large lobbies, budget-constrained |

### Idle timeout

| Timeout | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `0` | Never auto-stop (good for lobbies) |
| `60` | Aggressive cleanup (1 minute) |
| `300` | Balanced (5 minutes, good for minigames) |
| `900` | Conservative (15 minutes, good for longer game modes) |

### Players per instance

Set this to the **expected peak capacity**, not the absolute maximum. If your BedWars maps hold 16 players, set `players_per_instance = 16`. If your lobby can handle 200 but you want to keep it comfortable, set `players_per_instance = 100`.

::: tip
The `scale_threshold` and `players_per_instance` work together. A threshold of 0.8 with 16 players per instance means scaling triggers at 13 players on average per routable server.
