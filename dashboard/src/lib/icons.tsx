/**
 * Central re-export of the lucide-react icons used across the dashboard.
 *
 * Call sites should import from `@/lib/icons` rather than `lucide-react`
 * directly, so any future library swap or per-icon tweak only touches
 * this one file. Some names are exported twice (e.g. `Server` and
 * `ServerIcon`, `FolderTree` and `FolderTreeIcon`) because the call sites
 * mix both spellings — they resolve to the same lucide component.
 *
 * Aliases handle a few renames between older lucide releases and the
 * shadcn/ui scaffolding still in use:
 *   - `Loader2`          → `LoaderCircle`
 *   - `MoreHorizontal`   → `Ellipsis`
 *   - `MoreVertical`     → `EllipsisVertical`
